# NextJS13-typescript-practice

Simple practice application setup with ![Next JS](https://img.shields.io/badge/Next-black?style=for-the-badge&logo=next.js&logoColor=white) version 13, ![TailwindCSS](https://img.shields.io/badge/tailwindcss-%2338B2AC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=tailwind-css&logoColor=white) and ![TypeScript](https://img.shields.io/badge/typescript-%23007ACC.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=typescript&logoColor=white).

Uses two third party API's to fetch data, and use the built in server side components in the app directory in this new version of NextJS. I'm able to fetch data without setting up a getServerSideProps function, therefore making the process of fetching data easier. 
Also showcases the routing system of the new app directory.
